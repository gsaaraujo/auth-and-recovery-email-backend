## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

I've been focusing on studying Clean Architecture and SOLID for months in order to improve my skills in software quality. 

I do believe that either learning a new programming language or a new framework is the easier thing to do. Making the code more maintainable, decouple and testable though, definitely ain't easy. These aren't important to let your boss happy but to keep your own sanity.

You might've noticed lots of refactor commits. That's cuz I was testing different ways of dealing with different things. I've spend hours thinking where and how u're supposed to deal with certain errors, or if you should pass your entities throught usecases or create dtos instead, or even the true nature of entities, whether just a real world representation as POO says, or business rules representation only, or a mix of both.

Then I don't think that Clean Architecture is a instruction manual towards the perfect architecture. There's not such a thing. Nowadays productivity is a value coin that must be taken into account. 

If at least you use the fundamental concept of Clean Architecture, dividing your project into layers and follow the dependency rule, where the inner layer does not know about the outer one, and apply the SOLID principles, mostly the D (dependency inversion), which is in my option the most important one, the rest is just a mature decicion based on trade-offs. At the end of the day you're gonna end up with a very good software quality and be productive as well.
